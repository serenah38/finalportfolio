  <h3>the proposal</h3>
  <p>An addition to the existing Tribeca Film Festival application that extends the screening experience beyond the theatre to explore the diverse urban establishments of Manhattan</p>
  <h3>my role:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>research</li>
  <li>UX strategy</li>
  <li>copywriting</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> the brief</h3>
  <p>For this project, we were to utilize what we know about UX Strategy in order to research companies and analyze business problems. Amidst our analyses, we came across an opportunity for the Tribeca Film Festival.</h3>
  <p>We saw an opportunity within the disconnect between individual screenings to weave the festival together as a cohesive whole for festival goers.</p>
  <h3>the process</h3>
  <p>after extensive research, we framed the project as follows:</p>
  <p>How can we create a connection between the urban space and the aspirations of the festival to introduce a unique experience that is relevant to the community where Tribeca Film Festival belongs?</p>

  <p>How can we create a mutually beneficial relationship between Tribeca Film Festival and its local businesses?</p>

  <h3>value</h3>
  <p>Through the proposed extension, Tribeca Film Festival will be able to gain differentiation through leveraging their value of belonging to the community. It decreases cognitive overhead for the overwhelmed attendees, and provides exposure to the local businesses that have been shaping the Tribeca community, bringing character back to the neighbourhood.</p>
