  <h3>//serena ho</h3>
  <p> I'm currently a third year design student at SFU</p>

  <p>After spending years majoring in Kinesiology with nothing to show for it but a couple of semi-cool facts (sun activates synthesis of vitamin D in the body... it doesn't just beam down <em>rays of vitamin D</em>, people.), I've chanced upon something I really care about. Design is my way of doing something super cool to help contribute to people and the world.</p>

  <p>I'd love the chance to be able to work at an agency that puts together creative content for worldly causes and have a purposeful aspect to their work. I especially enjoy collaborative environments and the chance to work with a variety of different designers. Iâ€™d also like to incorporate my minor interest in health sciences to my work because it is a field that I feel requires a lot more incorporation of design.</p>
