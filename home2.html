    <h3>01/the proposal</h3>
    <p>A purposeful addition to the existing Tribeca Film Festival application, that extends the screening experience beyond the theatre to explore the diverse urban establishments of Manhattan.</p>

    <h3>02/insights</h3>
    <p>The Tribeca Film Festival itself was founded in 2001 to bring people back downtown after the tragedy of 9/11. The festival sought to help connect the community back together after such irrepairable change to the area. What then followed was the transformation into a unique neighborhood for culturally significant businesses to thrive.</p>

    <p>Since 2012, Tribeca Film Festival has been a frontrunner in innovative storytelling especially through non-film media and nonlinear storytelling such as VR and other immersive projects. However, other film festivals have also begun to implement non-film projects into their programming, so simply chasing new technology and media projects will not continue to be enough of a differentiator for festival-goers. However, what has always set Tribeca Film Festival apart from other film festivals is their value of community in parallel to their identity.</p>

    <p>Upon delving into the history behind the Tribeca Film Festival and its location in lower Manhattan, our team quickly realized the rising epidemic of gentrification that has been deeply affecting local businesses. As a result of skyrocketing rent prices, neighborhood businesses have been forced to relocate or permanently close, ultimately being replaced with larger corporate companies, causing an irreversible change to the character of the community.</p>

  <div class="process-text-y">
    <h3>03/the result</h3>
    <p>To begin, we asked ourselves:</p>
    <p>How can we create a connection between the urban space and the aspirations of the festival to introduce a unique experience that is relevant to the community where Tribeca Film Festival belongs?</p>
    <p>Through analyzing the Tribeca Film Festival experience for attendees, we saw an opportunity for individuals to explore the area in between festival screenings to learn how the festival was shaped and the community behind the historic neighborhood. We sought to unify the otherwise fragmented festival experience by drawing upon film-inspired cues to augment the adventure.</p>

    <h3>04/value</h3>
    <p>Through the proposed extension, Tribeca Film Festival will be able to gain differentiation through leveraging their value of belonging to the community. It will provide exposure to the local businesses that have been shaping the Tribeca community, bringing character back to the neighbourhood.</p>

    <h3>the concept</h3>
      <p>Originally based on the concept of a hot air balloon, our lamp evolved over the weeks to become a piece that encompasses the ideal of the moon and the soft light that it emanates. Using tissue paper to construct the spherical shade, the labor of the paper-mache process is revealed as a result of the distinct, layer-by-layer end product. The clear, acrylic plastic plays a vital role in diffusing the light and contributing to the lampâ€™s simple yet monumental concept. Through the use of the four-bars, the lamp may be extended along the horizontal axis to better suit the environment of use. Another option is to rotate the shade in order to provide individual directional lighting at the desired angle.</p>

    <h3>materiality</h3>
    <p>One reason we had chosen acrylic was that it behaves especially well under forceful impact, and when modified, can be scratch and impact-resistant. Acrylic plastic can also be colored, frosted, clear or black, providing us with many options to consider.</p>

    <p>Paper can be thin enough to allow light to pass through creating a soft ambient effect, hence why we took this into consideration when choosing tissue paper. Tissue paper can also be thick enough to diffuse light, especially when layered. This can be used to our advantage with areas of varying thickness, only allowing selective areas to be illuminated.</p>

        <h3>the process</h3>
        <p>To start construction of the lamp, we first applied the paper-mache technique to the tissue-paper lamp shade. Light strokes of white glue on the balloon allowed the paper to stick and become attached to the surface. Through repeated gluing and continuous layering, the paper-mache balloon eventually dried, and maintained its spherical shape that would reflect our lunar concept.</p>

        <p>Our acrylic sheet was first measured to determine our required dimensions and subsequently laser-cut into their respective pieces. In order to assemble the different pieces, we obtained a variety of nuts, screws and bolts to secure the individual parts to each other. A light was also attached to a piece of acrylic and placed inside the lamp to provide the finishing touch.</p>
